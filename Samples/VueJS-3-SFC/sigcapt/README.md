# SigCaptX sample code for Vue JS 3 using HTML

These samples were built using Vue JS 3.  
They are based on the simplest form of construction i.e. by retaining HTML and JS source files.  
The Vue framework is referenced simply by import and script statements in the HTML files.  
Functions are formed as methods of the Vue app.
Data items are used to handle the two-way interaction between the form input fields and the user entry.  
No preprocessing is required - the code can be deployed as is to a server.  

Note that as usual with sample code a licence key has not been provided.  
A suitable key needs to be populated in the LICENCEKEY const in SigCaptX-Globals.js.  
A standard production licence key can be found in the GETTING STARTED.md document at the top level of this Samples repository.
